## Overview
This challenge uses HTML and CSS to build a testimonial grid section that is responsive. The design was created to be as close to the example mobile and desktop designs as possible. 

Users should be able to:
- Resize the device screen for mobile and desktop with the mobile view showing the cards as a single column, the desktop view showing the cards in 2 rows (1st row: 1 card spans 2 columns, 1 card in 1 column, 1 card span 2 rows; 2nd row: 1 card in 1 column, 1 card spans 2 columns, 1 card span 2 rows)
