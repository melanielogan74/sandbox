## Overview
This challenge uses HTML and CSS to build a four card feature section that is responsive. The design was created to be as close to the example mobile and desktop designs as possible. 

Users should be able to:
- Resize the device screen for mobile and desktop with the mobile view showing the cards as a single column, the desktop view showing the cards in 3 columns (1 card on left, 2 cards in middle, 1 card on right)
